# An AI boosted english teaching chat 

This project aim to learn about React and typescript moslty, so everything related to backend like DB, auth and AI models are using OpenAI API and Supabase.

This project is focused around core concept of react like state management, immutability, etc and hands on implementations of basic typescript to learn how it is used.

Optimisation and clean code was not the main focus, even though I am planning to clean everything a bit more at the end of this project.

# Roadmap
## Features
I want to implement something that could allow users to translate word, and get synonym, right in
the interface

# CI / CD / DevOps
In order to continue learning Docker, I am planning to: 
 - Make a Docker image of this app
 - Make supabase run locally using the Supabase Docker image
 - Set Jenkins or Github Actions to automate testing
 - Deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster
 - use Jenkins or Github Actions to deploy it on the cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure)
 - Maybe implement some basic monitoring / logging functionalities
