# An AI boosted english teaching chat 

This project aim to learn about React and typescript moslty, so everything related to backend like DB, auth and AI models are using OpenAI API and Supabase.
This project is focused around core concept of react like state management, immutability, etc and hands on implementations of basic typescript to learn how it is used.
Optimisation and clean code was not the main focus, even though I am planning to clean everything a bit more at the end of this project.
